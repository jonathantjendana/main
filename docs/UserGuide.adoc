== Introduction

*MoneyGoWhere* is a personal finance application targeted to students at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
It allows students to keep track of all their spending and their related information such as date, cost and tags.
Users can also set budget goals, view statistics, set reminders for bills and export their data to a .csv file.
With an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI) and employment of Command Line Interface (CLI), users can easily navigate through the application, contributing to its user-friendliness and efficiency.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/apple`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/apple t/fruit` or as `n/apple`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `add n/NAME [t/TAG]...` can be used as `t/vegetable`, `t/fruit` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `add n/NAME c/COST`, `add c/COST n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a command accepts a single parameter and multiple parameters are provided, by default, the last parameter is chosen. e.g. if there is only one `n/NAME` accepted and the input is `n/One n/Two`, `n/Two` will be selected.

****
* At least one search field must be present.
* The search is case-insensitive. For example, `apple` and `Apple` will output the same search results.
* The order of the keywords do not matter for name and remarks. For example, `ticket concert` will match `concert ticket`.
* Spending matching at least one keyword will be returned. For example, `Phone` will return `New Phone`, `Phone Bill`.
* When searching for multiple tags, any tag listed will be matched along with the previous criteria. For example, if there the search keyword was `d/yesterday d/today t/food t/entertainment`, spending entries within `yesterday` and `today` that have either tags `food` or `entertainment` will be matched.
* Only full words will be matched. For example, `app` will not match `apple`.
* Date range can only be input in the following ways:

** `d/DATE_START d/DATE_END`

// tag::statistics[]
=== Generating statistics : `stats`
Organises the spending based on tags.
A pie chart is generated, with each sector representing the total amount of money spent on a tag.
This enables users to be more informed of their spending habits as they are now aware of where they have spent most of their money on.

*Format:* `stats d/DATE_START d/DATE_END`

****
* Generates statistics for all spending that fall between and including the DATE_START and DATE_END specified by the user.
* If no DATE_START and DATE_END parameters are specified, the statistics generated will be based on the whole list of spending.
* Only spending that have at least a tag will be considered.
* Only the top few tags which incurred a more significant amount of money  will be displayed.
****

[NOTE]
Spending with multiple tags will be counted more than once in total as the statistics seek to show the user which tag they have spent the most money on.

[NOTE]
DATE_START must be earlier or the same as DATE_END.

[TIP]
Date range can be input in the following ways: +
`d/DATE_START d/DATE_END` +
`d/DATE_START to DATE_END` +
`d/DATE_START - DATE_END`

[TIP]
The statistics panel will update every time the spending list displayed changes.
For example, when a new spending with a tag is added, the statistics panel will update the pie chart to show the statistics for all spending, including the new spending.

*Examples:*

* `stats`: Generates statistics for all spending.

.Output of `stats`
image::allstats.png[width="700"]

* `stats d/20/10/2019 d/25/10/2019`: Generates statistics for spending between and including 20/10/2019 and 25/10/2019.

.Output of `stats d/20/10/2019 d/25/10/2019`
image::daterangestats.png[width=700"]

*Expected Output:*

Statistics is shown.

// end::statistics[]

// tag::graph[]
=== Generating a graph : `graph`
Organises the spending based on date. A line graph is generated, with each point representing the total amount of money spent on a particular date.
This enables users to analyze trends in their spending amount over a particular period of time.

*Format:* `graph d/DATE_START d/DATE_END`

****
* Generates a graph for all spending that fall between and including the DATE_START and DATE_END specified by the user.
* If no DATE_START and DATE_END parameters are specified, the statistics generated will be based on the whole list of spending.
* Only dates that have at least a spending will be recorded in the graph.
****

[NOTE]
DATE_START must be earlier or the same as DATE_END.

[TIP]
Date range can be input in the following ways: +
`d/DATE_START d/DATE_END` +
`d/DATE_START to DATE_END` +
`d/DATE_START - DATE_END`

[TIP]
Hovering the mouse over a point displays the date and total amount of money spent (to the nearest dollar) on that date.

[TIP]
The graph panel will update every time the spending list displayed changes.
For example, when a new spending is added, the graph panel will update and generate a graph for all spending, including the new spending.

*Examples:*

* `graph`: Generates a graph for all spending.

.Output of `graph`
image::allgraph.png[width="700"]

* `graph d/20/10/2019 d/25/10/2019`: Generates a graph for spending between and including 20/10/2019 and 25/10/2019.
